# WorldTool Basic Functionality Test

## Test Description

This test validates the basic functionality of WorldTool and verifies cross-package interaction with the hello package.

## Expected Behavior

- Tool should execute successfully (exit code 0)
- Should generate greeting using HelloUtils from hello package
- Should display comprehensive world information including:
  - Global population statistics
  - Major world languages with speaker counts
  - Continental distribution data
- Should demonstrate proper cross-package dependency handling

## Cross-Package Dependencies

This test validates that:
- WorldTool can successfully import and use HelloUtils from hello package
- Cross-package functionality works correctly after compilation
- Classpath configuration properly includes both packages

## Validation Rules

1. **contains_greeting**: Output must start with greeting generated by HelloUtils
2. **contains_population**: Must include global population data (~8.1 billion)
3. **contains_languages**: Must list major world languages with speaker counts
4. **contains_continents**: Must include continental distribution information
5. **cross_package_interaction**: Must demonstrate successful helloâ†’world package usage
6. **no_errors**: Tool must not produce any error output

## Test Command

```bash
sh world.sh
```

## Success Criteria

- Exit code: 0
- Output contains all required data sections
- Greeting demonstrates cross-package functionality
- Proper formatting and structure maintained
- No compilation or runtime errors

## Notes

- This test serves as integration validation for multi-package projects
- Verifies that the compile.sh script correctly handles cross-package dependencies
- Demonstrates both HelloUtils and WorldUtils functionality in a single execution
